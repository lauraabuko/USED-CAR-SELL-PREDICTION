# USED-CAR-SELL-PREDICTION

# INTRODUCTION
# Overview

Finding a good car can sometimes be a hustle especially for first time car owners. This can be attributed to the fact that it is very easy to get conned into buying a vehicle that does not serve your purpose for the period you intend to own the vehicle. It might also be equally hard to resell your vehicle once you are done with it and you may end up selling it at a throw away price. It is equally hard for car dealers, especially second hand car dealers whose whole business is to buy and sell used cars as they face almost similar problems in selling second hand vehicles. It is therefore really important to understand how the second hand car market works before committing to purchase the car of your dreams.

# Defining our question

Create a model that predicts if a dealer will manage to sell a used car or not.

# Metrics for success

Visualising the relationships between the sold/unsld cars and various features
Building a model that can determine whether a dealer will sell a used car or not.
Identifying the top features influencing whether a dealer will sell a used car or not.

# Understanding context

A dealer may purchase a vehicle that is hard to resale which will adversely affect his business in terms of very low profits and sometimes losses which might end up putting him out of business. It is therefore really important for second hand car dealers to understand which vehicles to purchase for resale to increase his profit margins.

# Term Explanations

Torque

Torque is a twisting force that speaks to the engine's rotational force and measures how much of that twisting force is available when an engine exerts itself

A high torque enables efficient and energy-saving driving. A high engine power enables a car to accelerate quickly and reach a high top speed.
